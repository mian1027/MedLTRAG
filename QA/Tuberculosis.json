He denies alcohol use, tobacco consumption, and the use of recreational drugs. On examination, pulse rate is 76/min and is regular and bounding; blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. A triple apical impulse is observed on the precordium and a systolic ejection crescendo-decrescendo murmur is audible between the apex and the left sternal border along with a prominent fourth heart sound. The physician then asks the patient to take a deep breath, close his mouth, and pinch his nose and try to breathe out without allowing his cheeks to bulge out. In doing so, the intensity of the murmur increases. Which of the following hemodynamic changes would be observed first during this maneuver?",

    "question": "A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a 2-month history of a non-productive cough and fatigue. During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows 250 ml of turbid fluid. Analysis of the pleural fluid aspirate shows:\nErythrocyte count 1/mm3\nLeukocyte count 4,000/mm3\nGlucose 59 mg/dl\nLactate dehydrogenase 248 U/L\nProtein 3.8 g/dL\n. Which of the following are not the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion? There may be one or more correct choices.\"",
